  <h2>Comfortaa</h2>
  <p>Comfortaa was designed by Johan Askerlund. It is a sans serif rounded and geometric typeface intended to be used in larger sizes. I chose the letterform because of its rounded and geometric features. The typeface reminds me of something that could be used to brand a mattress because of its modern and cloudlike aesthetic. Comfortaa shares similarities with the font Quicksand because of its rounded endings but differs in the endings of certain letters making (<a href="https://www.dafont.com/comfortaa.font">Comfortaa</a>) more organic.</p>
