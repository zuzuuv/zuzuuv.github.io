<h2> About </h2>

 The concept of seasonal eating has guided the way Chinese have dined for millennia. But instead of a set progression of seasons and months—spring, summer, January, February, and so forth—that comes at the same time year in year out, the seasons in China have always been more fluid. This is because, rather than being subject to the dictates of man, these 24 seasons gracefully accommodate our planet’s relationship with the sun and moon.
